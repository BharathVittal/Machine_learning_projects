LOGSITIC REGRESSION

We have two projects here.

1. Advertising Campaign
/n
In this project we will be working with an advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

2. Titanic Dataset
/n
In this project we will be working with the [Titanic Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). This is a very famous data set and very often is a student's first step in machine learning! 

We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased.
